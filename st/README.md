## how 2 build if yo dumb

or use my [ebuild](https://github.com/GravityShark0/gravitypersonal)

0. [dependers](https://github.com/siduck/st#dependencies)

```
# Void
xbps-install libXft-devel libX11-devel harfbuzz-devel libXext-devel libXrender-devel libXinerama-devel gd-devel

# Debian (and ubuntu probably)
apt install build-essential libxft-dev libharfbuzz-dev libgd-dev

# Nix
nix develop github:siduck/st

# Arch
pacman -S gd

# Fedora (or Red-Hat based)
dnf install gd-devel libXft-devel

# SUSE (or openSUSE)
zypper in -t pattern devel_basis
zypper in gd-devel libXft-devel harfbuzz-devel

# Gentoo
emerge -av gd libXft xorg-server

# Install font-symbola and libXft-bgra
```

1. clone it lol

```
git clone https://github.com/GravityShark0/st-grav-flexipatch.git && cd st-grav-flexipatch
```

2. and go an build it and stuff

```
# make clean install
```

3. then hide your trace from the government

```
rm -fr * && rmdir ../st-grav-flexipatch
```

## how 3 use kinda

### the only shortcuts you are probably gonna use (just look in config.def.h for the others)

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Down</kbd> decrease font size by 2
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Up</kbd> increase font size by 2
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Home</kbd> reset font size to default
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> enter keyboard selection ([bindings](./patch/keyboardselect_reflow.txt))

## set themes

uhhh like

```
xrdb merge <theme path>
```

so yeah it can include other files and shit, and also install xrdb if you havent

### apply themes while terminals are still on (live reload)

you just do like and it kinda works

```
killall -USR1 st
```

so yeah you can do it at once too

```
xrdb <path> && killall -USR1 st &
```

### how 2 make yo own themes

go read theme files or something, go copy and make a new one, you can figure it out yourself

Thanks to [bakkeby](https://github.com/bakkeby/st-flexipatch) and to [suckless](https://st.suckless.org/)

### also if undercurl and colored not appearing in tmux do this

```
# get the latest terminfo
curl -LO https://invisible-island.net/datafiles/current/terminfo.src.gz && gunzip terminfo.src.gz
tic -xe tmux,tmux-256color terminfo.src
# or run as root if you want to apply  to all users
# sudo tic -xe tmux,tmux-256color terminfo.src
```

# original README

```
st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
